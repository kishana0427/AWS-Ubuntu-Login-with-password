how to login aws ubuntu instance with password:
===============================================
Logging into an AWS Ubuntu instance using a password is generally not recommended due to security reasons, as it is less secure than using SSH keys. However, if you must use password authentication, you can enable it by following these steps:

1. Access the Instance via SSH
Initially, you’ll need to access your instance using SSH with a key pair. If you’ve disabled or need to enable password authentication, you should be able to use the default ubuntu user:

bash
Copy code
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@18.61.61.30
2. Update SSH Configuration
Once logged in, you need to modify the SSH daemon configuration to allow password authentication.

Open SSH Configuration File:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Modify Configuration:

Find the following lines and ensure they are set to yes (if they do not exist, add them):

bash
Copy code
PasswordAuthentication yes
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
If you see PasswordAuthentication no or ChallengeResponseAuthentication no, change them to yes.

Save and Exit:

Save your changes (Ctrl + O) and exit (Ctrl + X).

Restart SSH Daemon:

Apply the changes by restarting the SSH service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart sshd
3. Set Up a Password for ubuntu User
By default, the ubuntu user may not have a password set. Set a password for the ubuntu user or any other user you intend to log in as:

bash
Copy code
sudo passwd ubuntu
You’ll be prompted to enter and confirm a new password.

4. Connect Using Password
Now you should be able to SSH into your instance using a password:

bash
Copy code
ssh ubuntu@18.61.61.30
When prompted, enter the password you set earlier.

5. Additional Security Considerations
Enabling password authentication increases the risk of brute-force attacks. To mitigate these risks:

Use Strong Passwords: Ensure that the password is complex and not easily guessable.
Limit IP Range: Restrict SSH access to a specific IP range or your own IP in the security group settings.
Consider Two-Factor Authentication: If available, use two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance security.
Monitor Logs: Regularly check /var/log/auth.log for any unauthorized access attempts.
Summary
While it’s generally safer to use SSH key pairs, if you need to enable password authentication for any reason, ensure that you follow the steps above and take additional security precautions to protect your instance.

It sounds like you're trying to SSH into an AWS Ubuntu instance, but you're encountering a permission issue related to the public key authentication. Here’s a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. Check SSH Key Configuration
Verify SSH Key Pair: Ensure you are using the correct private key associated with the EC2 instance. When launching an instance, you typically specify a key pair; you need the private key file (.pem) corresponding to that key pair.

bash
Copy code
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@18.61.61.30
Note: Replace /path/to/your-key.pem with the path to your actual key file.

Permissions: Make sure the private key file has the correct permissions. SSH requires that the key file is only readable by the user. You can set the correct permissions using:

bash
Copy code
chmod 400 /path/to/your-key.pem
2. Check Instance User
Default User: On AWS Ubuntu instances, the default user is typically ubuntu, not root. Try connecting as ubuntu:

bash
Copy code
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@18.61.61.30
If you need to switch to the root user after logging in as ubuntu, you can use:

bash
Copy code
sudo su -
3. Verify Security Group Rules
Port 22: Ensure that the security group associated with your EC2 instance allows inbound traffic on port 22 (SSH). You can check and modify this in the AWS Management Console under "Security Groups."
4. Check Instance's SSH Configuration
SSH Daemon Configuration: Confirm that the SSH daemon (sshd) on the instance is configured to accept key-based authentication. This can be checked by connecting to the instance using the AWS Systems Manager Session Manager if enabled, or through another method.

Look at /etc/ssh/sshd_config and ensure that:

bash
Copy code
PubkeyAuthentication yes
Also, make sure that the AuthorizedKeysFile directive points to the right location (usually ~/.ssh/authorized_keys).

5. Instance Metadata and Key Pair
Check Metadata: Verify that the correct key pair is associated with your EC2 instance. You can check this in the AWS Management Console under "Instances" -> select your instance -> "Description" tab.
6. Restart SSH Daemon
If you have access to the instance through another method (e.g., AWS Systems Manager), you can restart the SSH daemon:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart sshd
7. Check for User-Specific Issues
User Directories: Ensure that the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the instance contains the correct public key and has appropriate permissions (chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys).
8. Troubleshooting Commands
Verbose Output: To get more details about the SSH connection process, use the -v option for verbose output:

bash
Copy code
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem -v ubuntu@18.61.61.30
This can provide more information on where the authentication process is failing.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the issue with SSH access to your AWS Ubuntu instance. If you’re still encountering problems, please provide any specific error messages or additional context for further assistance.

The error message you're seeing, Permission denied (publickey), indicates that SSH authentication is failing because it can't use the public key you've provided, and it's not falling back to password authentication. Here’s how you can address this issue:

Common Causes and Solutions
1. Default User
AWS Ubuntu instances typically use ubuntu as the default user, not root. Try logging in as ubuntu instead:

bash
Copy code
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@18.61.61.30
2. Correct Private Key
Ensure that you are using the correct private key file that matches the public key associated with your EC2 instance. Check that the private key file has the correct permissions:

bash
Copy code
chmod 400 /path/to/your-key.pem
3. Security Group Settings
Confirm that the security group associated with your EC2 instance allows inbound SSH traffic on port 22:

Go to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to "EC2" -> "Instances".
Select your instance and look at the "Security groups" section.
Ensure there is a rule allowing inbound traffic on port 22 from your IP address or range.
4. Instance Metadata and Key Pair
Verify that the EC2 instance is using the key pair you are trying to connect with:

Go to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to "EC2" -> "Instances".
Select your instance and check the "Key pair name" field in the "Description" tab to ensure it matches the key you are using.
5. SSH Daemon Configuration
If you have another way to access the instance (e.g., AWS Systems Manager Session Manager), check the SSH configuration:

Verify that the SSH daemon is configured to allow key-based authentication. Check /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

bash
Copy code
PubkeyAuthentication yes
Make sure the AuthorizedKeysFile is pointing to the correct file:

bash
Copy code
AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys
Restart the SSH service if you made changes:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart sshd
6. Correct File Permissions
Ensure that the ~/.ssh directory and the authorized_keys file on the instance have correct permissions:

SSH directory:

bash
Copy code
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
Authorized keys file:

bash
Copy code
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
7. Instance Logs
Check the instance’s system logs for any errors related to SSH:

If you have access via another method (e.g., AWS Systems Manager), you can view the logs at /var/log/auth.log for authentication errors.
8. Verbose Mode
Use the -v flag to get more detailed SSH output which can help pinpoint where the authentication is failing:

bash
Copy code
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem -v ubuntu@18.61.61.30
9. Password Authentication
By default, AWS EC2 instances with key-based authentication will not allow password authentication. If you need to enable password authentication, you must modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

bash
Copy code
PasswordAuthentication yes
And then restart the SSH daemon:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart sshd
Note: Enabling password authentication is not recommended for security reasons, and it should be used with caution.

Summary
Most likely, you are either using the wrong default user or the wrong private key. Try logging in with the ubuntu user and ensure you’re using the correct private key. If the problem persists, verify your instance’s security group settings, SSH configuration, and permissions.
